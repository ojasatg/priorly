Q. Why you chose express and not sveltekit's api features?
A. Because I wanted to learn express and node as well. This will be useful in real world scenario where the APIs are developed and managed by a separate team and the APIs have heavy business/data logic to perform.

Q. Which auth mechanism are you using JWT or Session auth?
A. Using sessions for good control over security as JWT token once issued can be used by anyone if not expired. Session is just a map which can be invalidated easily. One downside of session storage is to maintain a cache.

Q. Why are you using CSRF Token?
A. So that each client instance can store this token on their "stores" to avoid CSRF issue.
